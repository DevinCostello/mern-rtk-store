# Full Stack MERN E-commerce Store

For this project I wanted to learn how to plan, organise and code a fullstack project from scratch. I ran into a few challenges but it was also a very rewarding experience as it gave me the understanding of how each technology integrates together and how to create similar projects in the future with more complexity and features. 

I aimed to make the code as clean and readable as possible as if I were working on a team. I also aimed to make the UI as clear and accessible as possible, as though actual users would be utilising the website


## Features:

- API created with Express and Node that serves product, user and filter data to the front-end

- All data is hosted on a MongoDB document-oriented database cluster and modelled using Mongoose ODM

- Fast and responsive UI created using React and routed with React Router

- More complex state interactions (such as filtering product data, adding items to cart) are handled using Redux global state manager

- All data is fetched, cached and invalidated using RTK Query as well as user-initiated HTTP requests (Adding items to cart, logging in/out and registering new users) are handled using RTK Queryâ€™s mutations

- JSON Web Token used to authenticate users and protect API routes when users are not logged in

## Links:

- [Website hosted here](https://mern-rtk-store.onrender.com/) (**Please note** It will take a few seconds for the API to boot up if the site hasn't been accessed recently)
- API is hosted from a seperate repo found [here](https://github.com/DevinCostello/mongoose-api)
